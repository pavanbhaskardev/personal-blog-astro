  Hi guys👋, It's been a while from my last blog. In this blog let's see what is
  Docker and how it can help you in your Self-Hosting journey.

  What is Self-Hosting anyway?
</Message>

<Message>
  <H2>Self Hosting</H2>

Self-Hosting means running software on your own computer,
rather than relying on third-party providers.
This gives you more control over your data, privacy, and customization options.

  Acha, got it. So how Docker helps in Self-Hosting?

  <H2>Docker</H2>

Docker is a visualization tool, that allows you to package all dependencies that are required to run a software.

Now you can run this package on any system that has Docker installed, without worrying about compatibility issues.

Running your software in Docker is a 3 step process:

1. **Dockerfile**: Configuration file contains what dependencies are required to run the software.
2. **Image**: It is package created using Dockerfile. It contains all the dependencies required to run the software.
3. **Container**: It is a running instance of your software.

  Ha, just create my software as package and run it anywhere. Sounds
  interesting!

 <H2>Example</H2>

- Assume you've a html portfolio page.
- We'll host this page using Docker on your laptop.
- We'll make it accessible over internet.

```bash
# Assume this is your project structure
|-- portfolio
    |-- index.html
    |-- Dockerfile
```

- Install Docker in your system from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Open Docker Desktop application and make sure it's running.
- Let's edit `Dockerfile`.

```bash
# You can find more details about Dockerfile commands here👇
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

# FROM command specifies the base image
# Using official nginx image as base image to serve our html page
FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# RUN command executes command
# Remove default nginx website html files
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# COPY command copies files from host to Docker image
# Copy your website files to nginx html directory
COPY ./index.html /usr/share/nginx/html

# EXPOSE command exposes port to host machine
# Expose port 80 We can access our website on http://localhost:8080
EXPOSE 80

# CMD command specifies the command to run when container starts
# Start nginx server and running in foreground
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

- Now let's create Docker image (package of our software) using this Dockerfile

```bash
# Here my-portfolio is the name of the image
# Run this command in terminal from portfolio directory
docker build -t my-portfolio .

# After successful build, you can see the image in your local docker images
docker images
```

- Now let's run this image in a container (running instance of our software)

```bash
# Here my-portfolio is the name of the image we created earlier
# -d flag runs the container in detached mode (in background)
# -p flag maps port 80 of container to port 8080 of host machine
docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-portfolio
```

- Now open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`, you can see your portfolio page is up and running 🎉
- Now to make it accessible over internet, you can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your localhost to internet.
- Install ngrok from [here](https://ngrok.com/download)

```bash
# Expose your localhost:8080 to internet
ngrok http 8080
```

- Now you can share the generated ngrok URL with your friends to access your portfolio page over internet.

  It'll take some time to digest, i got basic understanding of Docker now. How
  it's related to Self-Hosting?
</Message>

<Message>
  All companies and individuals who build Open Source software mostly have a
  Docker image of their software. 
  
  Those images can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). You can try out their software on your own
  machine using Docker.

**Example:**

- Let's self-host MongoDB database on your machine using Docker.

```bash
# Pull MongoDB image from Docker Hub
docker pull mongo

# Run MongoDB
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name my-mongo mongo
```

<Message character="chimtu" direction="right">
  Haaa! it's simple just `docker pull` and `docker run` commands. I can try most
  stuff out there!
</Message>

<Message>
  I just showed you tip of the iceberg. There are lot more things to explore in
  Docker. If you got basic understanding on these concepts, you can self-host mostly any software out there.

1. Docker Compose
2. Docker Volumes
3. Docker Networks
4. Docker Secrets
5. Docker Configs

  There's lot to learn.
</Message>

<Message>
Yess, at start i too felt same in beginning, Docker provides other advantages:

- Application Isolation [read more](https://dflow.sh/blog/stop-using-pm2-in-production-why-your-nodejs-app-deserves-better)
- Scalability

</Message>

<Message character="chimtu" direction="right">
  Can share me resources from where you learned Docker?
</Message>

<Message>

Sure! Here are some resources to learn Docker:

- [JS Mastery](https://youtu.be/GFgJkfScVNU)
- [Jims Garage](https://www.youtube.com/@Jims-Garage/videos)

  Time to start Self-Hosting, that's it for today folks✌️, see you in next blog!
