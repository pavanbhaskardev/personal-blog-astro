Hi guys👋, our home router which we connect for WIFI is actually combination of 3 different networking components

- Firewall
- Switch
- Wi-Fi Access Point

<Heading>Performance</Heading>

For everyday use, a home router delivers decent performance.

However, when multiple devices are connected or network usage increases, it can become a bottleneck.

The interesting part is, we can significantly improve performance without buying an expensive high-end router. Here's how we can do that?

<Heading as="h4">Plan</Heading>

Think of it this way:

1. One person doing three different jobs
2. Three people each doing one specific job

The 2nd approach is always more efficient. Instead of a single home router handling:

- firewall duties,
- switching,
- and Wi-Fi transmission,

we can separate these responsibilities into dedicated devices.

<Heading as="h5">Firewall</Heading>

- We can convert an old computer or laptop into a powerful firewall using tools like:
  - [Opnsense](https://opnsense.org)
  - [Pfsense](https://www.pfsense.org)
- These provide far more control and configuration options compared to a typical home router firewall.

**Requirements**:

- The system should have 2 Ethernet ports:
  - **WAN port** – connected to the ISP modem
  - **LAN port** – connected to a switch or access point

<Heading as="h5">Switch</Heading>

A switch allows us to connect multiple wired devices such as:

- desktops
- laptops
- TVs
- servers

This component is optional, but for **maximum speed and reliability**, wired Ethernet connections are always better than Wi-Fi.

<Heading as="h5">Access Point</Heading>

- Access point takes a wired network (Ethernet) and creates a new Wi-Fi network.
- Our devices can connect to this network.

By splitting responsibilities across dedicated devices:

- network performance improves
- scalability becomes easier
- upgrades can be done independently

This setup can be built on a **minimal budget** and scales very well. I haven’t implemented this setup at home yet!
