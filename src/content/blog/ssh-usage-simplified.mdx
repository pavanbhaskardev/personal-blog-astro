  Hi guys👋. If you've worked with servers you might already used SSH. In this
  blog I'll share a tool which simplifies your SSH usage.

  - For those who don't know, SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol.
  - It is used to securely connect to remote server or device over a network and access
  resources, execute commands on them.

  What if i told you that you can use VSCode as SSH client?
  - Yes, you can use VSCode as SSH client.
  - You can edit files, run commands, and manage your server directly from VSCode.

<Heading as="h4">Installation</Heading>

- Install [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) Extension from VSCode Marketplace.
  ![Remote-SSH VSCode
Plugin](/public/blog/ssh-usage-simplified/remote-ssh-vs-code-plugin.avif)

- After installation, click on the icon bottom-left corner.
  ![Remote-SSH option](/public/blog/ssh-usage-simplified/remote-ssh-select-option.webp)

- Click `Connect to Host` option, select `Configure SSH Hosts` and select your SSH config file ex: /Users/john-deo/.ssh/config
  ![Configure SSH Hosts](/public/blog/ssh-usage-simplified/remote-ssh-configuration.avif)
- Add your server connection details in the config file in this format:

```plaintext
Host server-name
    HostName 145.85.249.68
    User root
```

- Now again click on the icon bottom-left corner.
  - Select `Connect to Host` and select your server.
- VSCode now opens a new window and connects to your server.
- If password is enabled, it will prompt you to enter the password. If you use SSH key authentication, it'll connect directly using that key.
- Once connected, you can do all operations directly from VSCode.

> In background VSCode runs a nodejs server on the remote machine to facilitate this connection.

  A GUI can be really helpful it'll save lot of time.
  - No need for `cd`, `ls`, `cat` commands anymore.

  Another advantage is you get split terminal with SSH session.

- You can run multiple commands in parallel.
